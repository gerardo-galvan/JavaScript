/* When writing conditional statements, sometimes we need to use different types of operators to compare values. These operators are called comparison operators.
Here is a list of some handy comparison operators and their syntax:
	• Less than: <
	• Greater than: >
	• Less than or equal to: <=
	• Greater than or equal to: >=
	• Is equal to: ===
	• Is not equal to: !==
Comparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right. */
